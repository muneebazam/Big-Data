# Bigram

*A bigram is a sequence of two adjacent words from a string of words (tokens). A bigram is an n-gram for n=2. The frequency distribution of every bigram in a string is commonly used for simple statistical analysis of text in many applications, including in computational linguistics, cryptography, speech recognition, and so on.*
